clusters:
  # Development cluster using KinD

    # For example, you could specify Kubernetes version, node configuration, etc.

  # Staging cluster using k3s
  - name: staging-cluster
    provider: k3s
    # Provider-specific configuration would go here
    # For k3s, you might specify server configuration, networking options, etc.
